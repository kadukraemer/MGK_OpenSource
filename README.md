# MGK_UI_BUILDER
Adding Dynamic UI Generator and Config Builder for Tkinter

The idea is to create a simple app that allows users to dynamically create a UI configuration for a Tkinter application. The interface_builder.py file contains a DynamicUIGenerator class that takes a UI configuration and dynamically generates a Tkinter user interface based on it.
